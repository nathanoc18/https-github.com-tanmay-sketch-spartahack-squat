# Barbell Squats Computer Vision Project: SpartaHack

This project aims to use computer vision techniques to analyze and improve your squat form.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites
* Streamlit
* Mediapipe
* OpenCV
* NumPy
* Streamlit_webrtc

**Run the following command in your pipenv (virtual environment):**

`streamlit run demo.py`

Streamlit often tends to work better with `pipenv` than `venv`. In order to install your virtual environment, change to your project directory and run the following commands. 

`pip install pipenv`

Activating your shell (pipenv): `pipenv shell` 

`exit` command should deactivate your environment
